        <p>Hello everyone! My name is Channies_star but you can call me Holly :3 ! I LOVE
            writing songs and k-pop. I have been collecting albums and photocards since December 2023 and now
            have over 80+ albums and 200+ photocards hehe... Other than k-pop and collecting, I love nature and animals;
            I own a German Shepherd named Apollo and he is such a baby hehe; he is the dog who is above.
            I built this website to show you more of myself and share my collections and upcoming/released songs 
            I have written!! I will try my best to keep this updated for people who are intrested and to be honest
            myself as I lose track of my own collections these days ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€
            I really hope you enjoy it and if you have any feedback; please let me know by dming me on
